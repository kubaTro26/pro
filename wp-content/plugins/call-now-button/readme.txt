The web's #1 click to call button for your website! A very simple but powerful plugin that adds a Call Now Button to your website for your mobile visitors (only for responsive websites).

== Description ==

###What does the plugin do?

This plugin places a Call Now Button (click-to-call button) to the bottom of the screen which is **only visible for your mobile visitors**. Because your mobile visitors already have a phone in their hands this plugin will allow them to call you with one simple touch of the button.
No more navigating to the contact page and no more complicated copy/pasting or memorizing the phone number!

###Could not be easier!
The settings are very easy: enable and enter your phone number. That's it!

If you want to add some text to your button, that's possible. Entering text is fully optional - leaving it empty will show a nice circular phone button to your visitors (take a look at the screenshots).

###Need more control?
Under the **Presentation tab** you can change the color of the button, move it to a different location on the screen and limit the pages on which the button should be visible.

Under the **Settings menu** you'll find a bunch of features that allow you to enable click tracking in Google Analytics, fire a conversion tag so a call is registered as a conversion in Google Ads, adjust the size of the button or move the button further backwards in case you want something else to sit on top of it (e.g. your privacy notice).

###Need even more control?
Easily upgrade the plugin to Premium to add additional features such as multiple buttons, additional actions such as SMS/Text, Email, WhatsApp, Maps and links, a button scheduler, more advanced page selection options, Buttonbars and Multibuttons, a live preview window and much much more!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I enter my phone number? =

In the Settings section on your WordPress Dashboard you'll find a new addition: Call Now Button. Click on it to go to the plugin settings.

= Can I add text to the button? =

Yes, it is possible to add text to your button. You can chose to show the text inside the full width button across the bottom or top of the screen. It's also possible to add a text bubble next to the circular button. This works for all placements with the exception of the center button positions at the top an bottom of the screen.

= I don't see the button on my website but I'm looking at it with my mobile phone. Why? =

First step is to check if the button is enabled - this is the first checkbox on the settings page.

Next thing is to make sure that your theme is responsive. Responsive means that the website adapts to the size of the screen it's being viewed on. Simply put, if you need to zoom in to be able to read the text of your website on your mobile phone, the plugin will not work.

Last thing to check is if you have a caching plugin installed. Caching plugins make your website faster by showing a copy of your website instead of the actual website. As a consequence you will not see the Call Now Button because the copy was made before the button was installed. To fix this, go to your cache plugin settings page and empty the cache (sometimes called flush the cache). After doing this you should see the button. Do the same thing each time you make changes to the button.

= My website is responsive but I don't see the button

Check if you have any caching plugins active on your website. Your website is likely cached and you're looking at an older copy of your website. Delete/empty the cache and reload your website.

= I updated the button but I'm not seeing the changes on my website

You have a caching plugin active on your website and you are looking at a cached version of your website. Delete/empty the cache and reload your website.

= I only see the button on some pages of my website

You have a caching plugin active on your website and the cached pages are showing an older version of your website. Delete/empty the cache and reload the pages.

Another option could be that you have set the Call Now Button to only appear on specific pages. Go into the Call Now Button settings, open the Presentation tab and check that the field next to Limit appearance is empty.

= Do I have to add a country code to my phone number? =

You don't have to, but I recommend that you do to increase your options internationally.

= Do I start the number with + or 00? =

In most countries you'll be fine using either but there are some exceptions. To be on the safe side I would recommend using the plus sign.

= Can I change the appearance of the Call Now Button? =

Yes! You can easily change the color of the button and make it sit in any of the 8 preset locations across the screen of a phone. You also have the option to spread it out over the full bottom or top of the phone screen.

= I only want to show the button on a few pages. Is that possible?

Yes, you can enter the IDs of posts and pages you wish to include or exclude.

= I need way more flexibility! Isn't there a PRO version that I can use? =

Yes, you can upgrade to Premium to enable tons of extra features. Checkout [callnowbutton.com](https://callnowbutton.com/) to see what's included or just give it a try.
